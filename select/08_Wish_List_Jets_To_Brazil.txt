Mom and dad, can't remember if I told you
How glad I am I finally got to know you
Years from when we met
After I left home

Let me sing you sweet and distant fictions
On lonely nights you will lay and listen
If you don't like it
Wait until I fix it

Then morning comes and cops invade my conscience
I run around the house, a heated atom
Can't foresee the outcome
You can lean to one side

If I ever I should seem to take for granted
This lovely life that I have been handed
Darling, don't just stand there
Come knock me around

'Cause I know I can write my way out of this
Black hole, back to all the things that I miss
Sometimes I wonder if I even exist
Add another line to my wish list

The overview is not the same as going through
The present joy and all it took to come to this
To know the ending
Would be pretending

They took my words and wrote them off as passing
It pissed me off enough to keep me writing
Go make your living, boy
I'll go in fighting

'Cause I know I can write my way out of this
Black hole, back to all the things that I miss
You stay digging at your own little ditch
That's just another thing on my wish list

If I should slide over and under
You know I just might
Stay 'til I get it right

Some people say I'm corny or I'm morbid
I always thought I was touching, I was tragic
One man's magic
Is another's plastic

Well, which one is it, am I sweetness, am I sickness?
If I say both, you will say I lack commitment
Of course, you're right
Of course I'm right

But I know I can write my way out of this
Black hole, back to all the things that I miss
Sometimes I don't even know you exist
That's just another thing on my wish list
