Streets alive with Christmas lights
Twinkling in every eye
It all looks so beautiful to me

I got a list one mile long
Of things that I don't need
But they look so good on my touch screen

I gotta change this list that I have made
Not just for the holidays
But everyday

I wish for joy to come fill our hearts
I pray for peace and a brand new start
I wish for love and your kingdom
come
This is my wish list

Whoa O O
Whoa O O
Whoa O O O
Every Christmas this is my wish list

So take a box full of hope and love
Shiny paper go and wrap it up
It will be enough for me

I gotta change this list that I have made
Not just for the holidays
But everyday

I wish for joy to come fill our hearts
I pray for peace and a brand new start
I wish for love and your kingdom
come
This is my wish list

Whoa O O
Whoa O O
Whoa O O O
Every Christmas this is my wish list

I gotta change this list that I have made
Not just for the holidays
But everyday

I wish for joy to come fill our hearts
I pray for peace and a brand new start
I wish for love and your kingdom
come
This is my wish list

I wish the world would start looking up
Families would all have enough
I wish for love and your kingdom come
This is my wish list

Whoa O O
Whoa O O
Whoa O O O
Every Christmas this is my wish list
