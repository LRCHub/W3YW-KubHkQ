I dreamt the other day that on this earth
There was no such thing as race
Respect was shown on all that grows
On this great globe floatin' in space
And money wasn't stored, it was a crime to hoard
If brothers and sisters remained unfed
And the taxes for the guns went to rebuild all the slums
With clean streets and homes instead

It seems so right, it seems so real
Why must it be a dream?

And we invite cause it's how we feel
Why must it be a dream, wish list

Dreamt of a place somewhere in space where
Man treats a woman just like a friend
They see just souls, no pre-thought roles
All differences they would transcend
Where parents' love was unconditional
If there was need they would assist
And the family tree is healthy because
Love and trust have nourished it

It seems so right, it seems so real
Why must it be a dream?
And we invite cause it's how we feel
Why must it be a dream, wish list

Can you tell me why's this a dream?
When it seems so right
Why's this a dream?
(Dream)
My wish

It seems so right, it seems so real
Why must it be a dream?
And we invite cause it's how we feel
Why must it be a dream, wish list
