There are a lot of things I want this Christmas
I have a list of what to give and receive
But they don't come in boxes
Or wrapped in fancy paper
They just come in the simplest of things

Something weighs more than gold
The truth be told
Something new, so much more
Something's better than anything tangible
And it's all we need
It's all we need

Love
Peace
Joy
Kindness
Humility
Positivity
And not to live in fear
Love
Faith
Hope
Friendship
Forgiveness
Happiness
To last through the years

If there's one thing I have to be this Christmas
Is that I'd be a good example to the kids
To give my heart out to everyone who needs it
Life is not about the physical things

Something weighs more than gold
The truth be told
Something new, so much more
Something's better than anything tangible
And it's all we need
It's all we need

Love
Peace
Joy
Kindness
Humility
Positivity
And not to live in fear
Love
Faith
Hope
Friendship
Forgiveness
Happiness
To last through the years

Something weighs more than gold
Something new, so much more
So much more

Love
Peace
Joy
Kindness
Humility
Positivity
And not to live in fear
Love
Faith
Hope
Friendship
Forgiveness
Happiness
To last through the years
